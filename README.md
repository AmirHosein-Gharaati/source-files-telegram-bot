# source-files-telegram-bot

A telegram bot for searching files using sqlite3 databasse


## How it works

Used pyrogram framework(python language) and sqlite3 database for saving users, statuses and files.

The framework uses telegram api which is so fast for receiving and sending response.
## install

    pip3 install pyrogram tgcrypto
    
and follow [Pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) documentation for installing API_ID, API_HASH and BOT_TOKEN.


## Deploy

You can deploy this or any other bots to [Heroku](heroku.com) for FREE or you can deploy it on your own host or server (recommended).

**Note**: If you wanna deploy to heroku make sure you backup your files before stopping program from heroku hosts.
